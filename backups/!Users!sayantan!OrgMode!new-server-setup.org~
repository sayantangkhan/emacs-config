#+TITLE: New server setup

* Outline of architecture
We will have two servers: a cheap VPS running on DigitalOcean that's always on, and a server at home that's also always running.
The VPS will be used minimally, only for hosting stuff that always needs to be online, like the website, Syncthing, etc.
The home server will be used for most of the services, including the CPU heavy or space heavy services.
The configuration on both the servers needs to be as declarative as possible, so that everything that's running is documented, in case of server failures of any kind.

* VPS
** Hardware
DigitalOcean 5 USD VPS, or something even cheaper. No longer using Linode because the login experience is so messed up.
** Operating system
Use an OS with long update cycle, like Centos, RHEL, or Debian. No Ubuntu. But manage most services with Nix.
** Services
- [ ] Tailscale, with exit node (see if it can be managed via Nix)
- [ ] Syncthing (for the always on feature)
- [ ] Nginx for website (the main website: the various subdomains will be on home server) (Nixify this as well)
- [ ] Service to regenerate the website based on source updates (figure out how to do this)
- [ ] Auto-update service?
- [ ] ssh

* Home server
** Hardware
Will use Thinkpad T420s for now: possibly get a larger internal hard drive for later, or upgrade to a more beefy server computer.
** Operating system
Might use Debian, since that supports btrfs best amongst the three candidates.
** Services
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Jellyfin (to do youtube and other videos)
- [ ] jupyter.sayantankhan.io
- [ ] orgmode.sayantankhan.io (with a secondary service to turn Org-to-Things, with good error logging)
- [ ] Auto-update service?
- [X] Btrfs backup service (check if this triggers)
- [X] Service to rebalance btrfs every so often (check if this triggers)
- [X] Podgrab (in a docker container, that I should Ansiblize)
- [X] Tailscale
- [X] ssh
- [X] Syncthing
- [ ] Build farm?
- [ ] Nix cache?

* Data hoarding
** Podcasts
- [X] Kill James Bond
- [X] Bikes or Death
- [ ] 10k posts
- [X] War on Cars
- [X] Escape Collective
- [ ] The true crime ones
- [X] The Magnus Archives
- [X] Radiolab
** TV shows
- [ ] Derry Girls
- [ ] The Good Place
- [ ] Limmy's show
- [ ] Peep Show
- [ ] Mitchell and Webb
- [ ] Watchmen
- [ ] Trailer Park Boys
** Movies
- [ ] Bicycle Thieves

* Home server specifics
** Initial setup
- Set up ~sudo~.
- Install ~nix~.
- Install ~home-manager~.
- Symlink ~home.nix~ to the actual file.
- Set up ~/home/sayantan/Sync~ to be a btrfs subvolume.
- Set up Syncthing to sync with remote server.
- Symlink ~home-manager-nix~ folder.
- Install ~podman~.
- Set up the podman service directory: ~mkdir -p /home/sayantan/.config/containers/systemd/~.
- Detect service files: ~systemctl --user daemon-reload~.
** Podgrab
- Run podgrab without mounting any volumes, using ~docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name=podgrab akhilrex/podgrab~.
- Copy the ~podgrab.db~ file from within the container to ~/home/sayantan/configs/podgrab/~.
- Start and install the service: ~systemctl --user start podgrab.service~.
** Other services
