:END:
Cancelled because I got the Bianchi Volpe, which essentially fills the same niche, albeit with rim instead of disc brakes.
- Price: 2.5k USD (in early 2023) for a SRAM 1x11 mechanical Rival
** Reasons to buy
- Good for easy long rides, both on road and gravel.
- The 1x groupset would also make for a good commuter.
- The price is not too high for the next bike upgrade.
- Cheap way to try out gravel and bikepacking events.
** Reasons to not buy
- Other than being able to handle worse gravel, I can already do the other stuff on the Trek Domane.
- Could add an extra 2k USD for a really nice gravel bike.
** Pros
- Relatively inexpensive for a steel bike with good parts.
- Lilac is a great color.
- Good tire clearance.
- Threaded bottom bracket (which is supposed to be the good kind).
** Cons
- Heavy steel bike.
- Shape of the frame is a bit boring (but functional).

[[https://whatsonzwift.com/workouts/gran-fondo][Description]] of training plan.
** Week 1
*** DONE W1: Welcome Workout
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-04 Sat>
The zone benchmarking test felt a little bit too easy. Could be that I'm having a better day than usual, or the day of ramp test was much worse than usual.
Should bias the next workout ever so slightly higher (10%?).
*** DONE W2: Introductory Intervals
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-06 Mon>
Felt like a 5 out of 10 at 110% bias, but it's supposed to feel easy, so I'll keep the bias at 110% for now.
*** DONE W3: Endurance free ride
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-08 Wed>
Squeeze in a long-ish hour long bike ride in the morning?
UPDATE: Actually did a 100k on Saturday 11th Feb instead.
*** DONE W3.5: Recovery ride
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-13 Mon>
Did a short (30 minutes) recovery ride just to get legs moving. Didn't go on for longer because I hadn't eaten enough.
*** DONE W4: Long ride: spiked base
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-16 Thu>
Unclear whether I'll actually have a 1.5 hour block free on Monday though.
UPDATE: Did it on Thursday instead. Felt alright, the third block felt right at my limit.
** Week 2
*** DONE W4.25 Hill repeats
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-18 Sat>
Did 5 repeats of the Broadway climb segment on my commuter bike.
For the future 6 or 7 reps on the lighter bike with harder efforts might be a good outdoor workout.
Need the heart rate monitor to determine intensity.
*** DONE W5: Long tempo intervals
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-21 Tue>
Did on Tuesday. Felt easy enough with enough food eaten a couple of hours before the workout.
*** DONE W5.5: Zwift race?
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-22 Wed>
Tried a Zwift race on Wednesday. It was a bust. Possible issues (in decreasing order of likelihood):
- Paced myself improperly: I should have been in draft in flats and downhills, and pull ahead during the long climbs, since my relatively low weight helps there.
- Gave up at precisely the wrong moment, just as the pace was easing off.
- Raced too late in the day, when I didn't have enough food.
- Did an overly long warmup (160-200 W for 30 mins, with 15 min. break) (this is possible, but unlikely)
**** Things to fix for next time
- Practice switching to a harder gear when I'm already putting down power.
- Try not too be at the head of the race at the very beginning, but rather stay with a large group close to the front.
*** DONE W6: Make a break for it
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-25 Sat>
*** DONE W7: Endurance free ride
SCHEDULED: <2023-02-26 Sun>
Did a 50k loop on my commuter bike, which was still faster than my previous average on the Trek.
*** CANCELLED W7.5: SST (Short) or 2x10@FTP
SCHEDULED: <2023-03-01 Wed>
Did a couple of long outdoor rides instead
*** DONE W8: Long ride spiked base progressive VO2
SCHEDULED: <2023-03-11 Sat>
Finished about 75% if the workout since I wasn't fully recovered from the cold. Marking it
as done for now, but might come back to it in the future.

** DONE Bike modifications
*** DONE Saddle pack quick mount
Remove the topeak saddle pack quick mount.
*** DONE Front roll
Position the front roll higher up and leave enough clearance for the front tire.
Also center the contents of the roll.
I need a strap to position it higher. Hopefully it doesn't ruin the stem.
*** DONE Garmin mount
Remove the out front mount, and replace it with the stem mount.
*** DONE Pedals
Swap out to the SPD/flat hybrid.
** Gear
** DONE Post event notes
*** Things I can ditch/should get
- Didn't really use spare clothes: slept in cycling shorts, and wore the light jacket as a second layer. Could do the same for future overnighters.
- Should have brought a cup to drink coffee in.
- Sleeping arrangement was too cold. Need a pillow and sleeping pad perhaps?
*** Packing
- Tried a lighter load up front with heavier stuff back on the way back. I prefer the first version, which is all tent stuff in the front, and all clothes and sleeping bag in the back. That made climbs much easier.
- Get adjustable straps (x2) for the front bag.

** Route GPX
[[https://www.komoot.com/tour/891737451?ref=wtd][Komoot link]] to ride.
** Review
The route is pretty well paved, for the first half at least. Almost no car traffic for most of the ride,
and even when I did encounter traffic, it was in small bursts, and passed by respectfully.
The pavement on the second half of the road is not as smooth, but still manageable by a thin road slick tire.

The only cons are that it's not hilly enough to be entertaining, and the endless views of flat farmland get a little boring.

A solid 8/10 road ride.
