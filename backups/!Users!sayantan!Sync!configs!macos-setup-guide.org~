#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC
*** Brew commands
- Updating homebrew and the installed packages definitions (formulae)
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew update
  #+END_SRC
- Listing outdated packages
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew outdated
  #+END_SRC
- Upgrading packages
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew upgrade
  #+END_SRC
** DONE Rust
** CANCELLED Haskell
** DONE LaTeX
Install MacTeX.
** CANCELLED Nix
*** Reason for cancellation
Nix on MacOS is more complicated, and involves setting up a daemon.
*** Installation
Run the following command.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
#+END_SRC
To verify success of the installation, check the version.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-env --version
#+END_SRC
* Installing GUI applications
** DONE iTerm2
*** Install and setup tmux integration
*** Keyboard shortcut
** DONE Firefox
Get rid of the front page clutter and compactify the layout. Then
install the following extensions.
- Firefox Multi-account containers
- uBlock Origin
- Zotero connector
- PassFF
- Reddit Enhancement Suite

Create 2 containers, Personal and Banking.

Also, make firefox the default browser.
** DONE Chrome
Install chrome from the website, and log into the `umich.edu` account.
** DONE Zotero
Install Zotero from the website (might have to install Rosetta), and set up syncing from the GUI.
** WAITING Emacs
Install emacs from homebrew.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install --cask emacs
#+END_SRC

Then, install Cask from the github repo.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
#+END_SRC
Following the installation of Cask, symlink the contents of the `emacs-config` directory to `.emacs.d`.  Run
~cask install~ in the directory and enable the emacs service.

To set up the emacs daemon, see this [[https://briansunter.com/blog/emacs-daemon-macos][link]]. To create a separate app icon for ~emacsclient~, see this [[https://blog.lambda.cx/posts/using-emacsclient-on-macos/][link]].

Also, figure out how to associate emacsclient with various filetypes.
** VSCode
Install VSCode from the App store. Then install the following addons
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
code --install-extension bungcip.better-toml
code --install-extension matklad.rust-analyzer
code --install-extension vscodevim.vim
code --install-extension haskell.haskell
code --install-extension hoovercj.haskell-linter
#+END_SRC
** Zoom
* Services
** DONE Tailscale
Follow the instructions on [[https://tailscale.com/download/mac][this website]].
** CANCELLED Home manager
First, copy the ~Sync~ directory from one of my other computers, and create  a ~home-manager-nix~ directory in the home folder that points to ~Sync/configs/mac-mini/~.

Then install home-manager by following the instructions [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][here]].
Once that's done, we symlink home.nix to the bundled file, and
run `home-manager switch`. This will take a while. Some of the components
will require additional configuration.
** DONE Syncthing
Go to localhost:8384, and configure it to sync to centos-crimson:8384.
** DONE Pass
Use the ~nixpkgs~ version of ~pass~. Copy over the password store and import the gpg keys.
Make sure copying works correctly, and the firefox plugin does too.
